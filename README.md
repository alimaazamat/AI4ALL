# AI4ALL Recipe Recommendation System

## Project Description
As global food demand rises, the environmental impact associated with it intensifies. Notably, about a third of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are linked to food, primarily from agricultural practices and land use. Our Recipe Recommendation System is designed to empower eco-conscious consumers, educators, and community organizations by providing smart, machine learning-driven tools to make food choices that are both healthy for people and the planet. By optimizing recipe selections based on personal dietary preferences and environmental impact, our system aims to reduce the user's carbon footprint through informed decisions.

## Project Details
- **Goal:** Leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to recommend recipes that minimize carbon footprints.
- **Product:** A recipe recommendation engine that filters and suggests recipes based on users' historical ratings and other relevant features.
- **Target Users:** Eco-conscious individuals, vegans, vegetarians, educators, students, nonprofits, and community organizations.
- **Approaches Used:**
  - **Collaborative Filtering:** Predicts and recommends new recipes using user ratings and similarities among users.
  - **Content Filtering:** Matches recipes to users based on carbon footprint, preparation difficulty, and nutritional content.
  - **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** Analyzes ratings data to capture hidden preferences and attributes, improving recommendation accuracy.
